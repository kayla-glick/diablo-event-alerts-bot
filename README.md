### Usage

After inviting the bot to your server, you'll see a new `#d4-event-alerts` channel. You're welcome to move this channel anywhere on your server,
but if you rename it the bot won't work.

Users can use the `/d4-alerts` command to choose which types of notifications they want to receive.

By default there are 3 roles corresponding with the 3 event types:

- `D4 Alerts Helltide`
- `D4 Alerts Legion`
- `D4 Alerts World Boss`

### Disclaimer

This is my first time creating a Discord bot so there may be bugs with it. If you have feedback or encounter a bug feel free to submit an issue.
